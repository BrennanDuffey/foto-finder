## General Info

A project creating a UI from a flat image using HTML, CSS, and JS for Turing's Front-End Mod 1 program.

## Motivation

Foto Finder was a project assigned as a final solo project in Mod 1 at Turing.  We were given a flat image with styling details (e.g. hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This project consisted working partly with HTML and CSS, but primarily with JS.  This is the original design in desktop and mobile formats:

## Features

* UI built according to project guidelines
– Responsive for all screen sizes

- Save in local storage and cards persist on reload 
- Edit content after photo card has been created
– Favorite a card and have that persist on reload
- Delete card upon hitting trash button

– UI shows the 10 most recent photo cards by default. Clicking "Show more" will display all cards; "Show less" - back to default.

## How to Use

1) Enter values into the Title and Caption form as well as enter an image file to upload. Upon clicking "Save", a card should appear below with the entered values displayed and the image file displayed.
2) Clicking on the title or caption of the card will give the ability to edit the values.
3) Clicking on the heart button will reassign the favorite value of the card to a boolean.
4) Clicking the trash button will delete the card.
5) If there are more than 10 cards, only the 10 most recent cards are displayed. By pressing the "Show more" button, all cards can be viewed. Then by pressing "Show less," it again shows the 10 most recent cards.
6) Typing in the search box will display results in real time.
7) Upon reloading page, all current idea cards will persist and be displayed.
8) Upon clicking the show favorites button only the favorited cards will display, and change the button to show all. Clicking this button will return all the photos
